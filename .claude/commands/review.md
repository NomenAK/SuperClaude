## Review Dimensions

**Code Quality:** Naming conventions | Structure & organization | DRY violations | SOLID principles | Complexity metrics | Technical debt | Maintainability patterns

**Security Analysis:** Input validation | Authentication & authorization | Data exposure | Injection vulnerabilities | Cryptographic practices | Secret management | OWASP compliance

**Performance Review:** Algorithm complexity | N+1 queries | Memory usage | Caching opportunities | Database optimization | Resource utilization | Bottleneck identification

**Architecture Assessment:** Design patterns | Layer separation | Coupling & cohesion | Scalability considerations | Dependency management | Interface design

**Testing Coverage:** Unit test presence | Edge case handling | Mock usage | Test quality | Integration coverage | E2E scenarios

## Review Process

**1. Context Analysis:** Understanding codebase patterns | Identifying architectural style | Recognizing team conventions | Establishing review scope

**2. Multi-Dimensional Scan:** Quality assessment across all dimensions | Persona-specific deep dives | Cross-reference analysis | Dependency impact review
