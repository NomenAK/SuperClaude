## Universal Execution Lifecycle

```yaml
Standard_Lifecycle:
  Pre_Execution:
    Risk_Assessment:
      Calculate: "Assess operation risk level"
      Factors: ["Data loss potential", "Irreversibility", "Scope", "Security"]
      Actions:
        Low: "Proceed w/ monitoring"
        Medium: "Warn & log"
        High: "Require confirmation"
        Critical: "Block & alert"
    Environment_Validation:
      Check: ["Required tools", "Permissions", "Resources", "Dependencies"]
      Verify: ["Git state", "Network access", "Disk space", "Memory"]
      MCP_Health: "Test server connectivity & response"
    State_Preparation:
      TodoList_Triggers: "@include ../../task-management-patterns.yml#Auto_Trigger_Rules"
      Checkpoint: "@include ../../recovery-state-patterns.yml#Automatic_Triggers"
      Cache: "Previous results for efficiency"
      Lock: "Prevent concurrent modifications"
      MCP_Cache_Init: "@include ../../mcp-cache-patterns.yml#Cache_Storage"
      
  During_Execution:
    Progress_Monitoring:
      Track: ["Operation progress", "Resource usage", "Error rates", "Token consumption"]
      Alert: ["Performance degradation", "Approaching limits", "Anomalies", "MCP failures"]
    Dynamic_Optimization:
      Adapt: ["Adjust parallelism", "Switch strategies", "Cache results", "Fallback to native"]
      Fallback: ["Use alternatives if primary fails", "Degrade gracefully"]
    Error_Handling:
      "@include ../../recovery-state-patterns.yml#Recovery_Framework"
      
  Post_Execution:
    Verification:
      Confirm: ["Expected outcomes achieved", "No side effects", "State consistent"]
      Validate: ["Output quality", "Performance metrics", "Security compliance"]
    Cleanup:
      Remove: ["Temp files", "Locks", "Cached data"]
      Update: ["Audit logs", "Metrics", "Documentation"]
    Reporting:
      Generate: ["Success/failure report", "Performance metrics", "Recommendations"]
      Store: ".claudedocs/lifecycle/execution-{timestamp}.md"
```
