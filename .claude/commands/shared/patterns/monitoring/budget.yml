## Token Budget Management

```yaml
Cost_Categories:
  Native_Tools: "No token cost"
  Light_MCP: "Minimal usage"
  Medium_MCP: "Moderate usage"
  Heavy_MCP: "Extensive usage"
  
Budget_Escalation:
  1: "Native first for simple tasks"
  2: "C7 for library questions"
  3: "Sequential for complex analysis"
  4: "Combine MCPs for synergy"
  
Abort_Conditions:
  Context_Usage: "High context usage → native tools"
  Timeout_Errors: "MCP timeout/error → fallback"
  Diminishing_Returns: "Poor results → stop MCP usage"
