## Estimation Methodology

```yaml
Estimation_Methodology:
  Time_Estimation_Framework:
    Development_Phases:
      Planning: "Requirements analysis & design: 10-15% of total"
      Implementation: "Core development work: 50-60% of total"
      Testing: "Unit, integration & system testing: 15-25% of total"
      Integration: "System integration & deployment: 5-10% of total"
      Buffer: "Unknown unknowns & contingency: 10-20% of total"
      
  Complexity_Scoring:
    Low_Complexity: "Well-understood, established patterns: 1-3 days"
    Medium_Complexity: "Some unknowns, moderate integration: 3-10 days"
    High_Complexity: "Research required, complex integration: 1-4 weeks"
    Very_High_Complexity: "New technology, architectural changes: 1-3 months"
    
  Team_Velocity_Factors:
    Solo_Developer: "Multiplier: 1.0 (baseline)"
    Small_Team_2_3: "Multiplier: 0.8 (coordination overhead)"
    Medium_Team_4_8: "Multiplier: 0.6 (communication overhead)"
    Large_Team_9Plus: "Multiplier: 0.4 (significant coordination)"
    
  Risk_Assessment_Framework:
    Technical_Risks:
      New_Technology: "Learning curve impact: +25-50% time"
      Complex_Integration: "Multiple system touchpoints: +20-40% time"
      Performance_Requirements: "Optimization needs: +15-30% time"
      Legacy_System_Integration: "Technical debt impact: +30-60% time"
      
    Resource_Risks:
      Key_Person_Dependency: "Single expert required: +20-40% time"
      External_Dependencies: "Third-party deliverables: +10-30% time"
      Skill_Gap: "Team learning required: +25-50% time"
      
  Estimation_Output_Format:
    Three_Point_Estimation:
      Optimistic: "Best case scenario (10% probability)"
      Realistic: "Most likely outcome (50% probability)"
      Pessimistic: "Worst case scenario (90% probability)"
      
    Confidence_Levels:
      High_Confidence: "Well-understood requirements: ±10%"
      Medium_Confidence: "Some unknowns present: ±25%"
      Low_Confidence: "Significant uncertainties: ±50%"
      
    Resource_Planning:
      Developer_Hours: "Total development effort"
      QA_Hours: "Testing & quality assurance effort"
      DevOps_Hours: "Deployment & infrastructure setup"
      Project_Management: "Coordination & communication overhead"
