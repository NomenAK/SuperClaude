# auto-task-trigger.yml - Seamless Automatic Task Mode

## Complexity Analysis Engine
```yaml
requirement_parser:
  extract_keywords:
    trigger_verbs: ["build", "create", "implement", "develop", "design", "add", "integrate"]
    scope_nouns: ["system", "feature", "functionality", "component", "service", "application"]
    complexity_flags: ["authentication", "database", "API", "full-stack", "architecture", "integration"]
    
  scoring_system:
    base_score: 0
    trigger_verb: +2 points
    scope_noun: +2 points  
    complexity_flag: +3 points
    multi_step_indicator: +3 points
    file_estimate: files * 1 point
    
  thresholds:
    auto_create: ≥8 points
    suggest_create: 5-7 points
    proceed_normal: <5 points

pattern_detection:
  high_complexity_patterns:
    - "build a * system"
    - "create * authentication"
    - "implement * database"
    - "develop * application"
    - "full-stack *"
    - "end-to-end *"
    
  multi_session_indicators:
    - "complete *"
    - "entire *"
    - "comprehensive *"
    - mentions of multiple technologies
    - frontend + backend mentions
    - database + API mentions
```

## Seamless Auto-Creation
```yaml
execution_flow:
  1_silent_analysis:
    - parse requirement in background
    - calculate complexity score
    - no user interruption
    
  2_instant_decision:
    score ≥8: auto_create_immediately
    score 5-7: brief_notification_then_create
    score <5: proceed_without_task
    
  3_background_setup:
    - generate task ID
    - create task file
    - setup git branch
    - move to in-progress
    - begin implementation
    
user_notification:
  high_complexity: "[Task created: {id}] {brief_description}"
  medium_complexity: "[Multi-step work detected - creating task] {brief_description}"
  format: single_line_notification
  timing: after_creation_before_work
  
no_interruption_policy:
  - never ask "should I create a task?"
  - never wait for confirmation
  - never pause workflow
  - seamless background operation
```

## Context Preservation
```yaml
auto_save_triggers:
  context_threshold: >70% full
  session_timeout: >30min inactive
  error_recovery: on failures
  manual_break: user requests pause
  
seamless_recovery:
  startup_scan: check ./claudedocs/tasks/in-progress/
  auto_resume: highest priority active task
  context_restore: previous session state
  notification: "Resuming: {task_title}"
  
session_continuity:
  preserve_state: file paths, variables, decisions
  track_progress: completed steps, current focus
  handle_blockers: previous issues & solutions
  maintain_context: architectural decisions
```

## Integration Patterns
```yaml
command_integration:
  /user:build → auto-detect complexity → create task if needed → proceed
  /user:implement → always create task → breakdown → execute
  /user:create → analyze scope → task if multi-step → proceed
  
plan_mode_integration:
  exit_plan_mode:
    - analyze plan complexity
    - count steps, files, technologies
    - if complexity ≥8: "Create task to track this plan? (y/n)"
    - if yes: create task with plan content
    - track plan execution through task
  
  planning_triggers:
    - --plan flag detected
    - risky operations (deploy, migrate)
    - multi-phase work identified
    - cross-cutting concerns
  
persona_activation:
  architect: high complexity systems
  frontend: UI/component requests  
  backend: API/database work
  security: authentication/authorization
  
workflow_chains:
  detect → create → breakdown → branch → implement → test → complete
  requirement → task → steps → code → validation → merge
  plan → analyze → suggest task → create → track → complete
