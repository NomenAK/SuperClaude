# Shell Script Fixes Applied

## Summary of Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed version comparison error in install.sh:49
**Issue**: `return $(check_system_requirements)` was incorrect syntax
**Fix**: Changed to `check_system_requirements; return $?` to properly capture and return the exit code

### 2. Fixed missing YAML configuration handling in Scripts/shell/requirements.sh
**Issue**: Script expected YAML file but only had hardcoded fallback values
**Fix**: Implemented proper YAML parsing with grep/awk for simple key extraction, with fallback to hardcoded defaults if file is missing or parsing fails

### 3. Added proper error handling for Python script execution
**Issue**: No validation before executing Python script in Scripts/shell/operations/install.sh:35
**Fix**: Added comprehensive validation:
- Check if Python script exists
- Check if script is readable
- Verify Python 3 is available
- Enhanced error reporting with exit code interpretation
- Added execution logging for debugging

### 4. Fixed module loading error messages
**Issue**: Generic error messages in install.sh:26-31 without specifying which module failed
**Fix**: Added specific module names to each error message:
- "Core module 'common.sh' not found"
- "OS detection module 'os-detection.sh' not found"
- "Requirements module 'requirements.sh' not found"
- "Security module 'utils/security.sh' not found"
- "Install operations module 'operations/install.sh' not found"
- "Update operations module 'operations/update.sh' not found"
- "Uninstall operations module 'operations/uninstall.sh' not found"

## Additional Improvements

### Error Handling Enhancements
- Added validation for each sourced module with specific error messages
- Improved Python execution error handling with exit code interpretation
- Added logging of the actual command being executed for debugging

### YAML Configuration Robustness
- Made YAML configuration optional with sensible defaults
- Added simple YAML parsing that extracts version requirements
- Falls back to hardcoded values if YAML is missing or malformed
- Logs whether configuration was loaded from YAML or defaults

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Existing installations will continue to work
- No breaking changes to the API or expected behavior
