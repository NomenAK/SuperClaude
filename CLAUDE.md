## Core Configuration

```yaml
Philosophy: Code>docs | Simple→complex | Security→evidence→quality
Communication: Professional format | Symbols: →|&|:|» | Structured>prose
Workflow: TodoRead()→TodoWrite(3+)→Execute | Real-time tracking
Stack: React|TS|Vite + Node|Express|PostgreSQL + Git|ESLint|Jest
Commands: /<command> [flags] | Professional workflows | 18 commands total
```

## Professional Thinking Modes

```yaml
Activation: Natural language OR command flags | Context-aware depth selection
Flags: --think | --think-hard | --ultrathink | Progressive complexity
none: Single file|Basic operations | Standard: Multi-file|Standard analysis
think: Multi-file|Architectural analysis | hard: System design|Complex integration  
ultrathink: Critical analysis|Complete redesign | ultra: Maximum depth analysis
Integration: /analyze --code --think | /design --api --ultrathink | /troubleshoot --prod --ultrathink
```

## Advanced Token Economy

```yaml
Optimization_Targets: Professional efficiency | Evidence-based responses | Structured deliverables
Template_System: @include shared/*.yml | 70% reduction achieved | Reference validation
Symbols: →(leads to) |(separator) &(combine) :(define) »(sequence) @(location)
