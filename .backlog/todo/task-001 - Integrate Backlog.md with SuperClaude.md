# Description

Integrate Backlog.md, a Markdown-native task manager and Kanban visualizer, into the SuperClaude development framework. This will provide visual task management capabilities and persistent task storage using markdown files.

## Objective

Create a seamless integration between SuperClaude's existing two-tier task system and Backlog.md's Kanban board visualization, enabling:
- Visual task management through Kanban boards
- Markdown-based task persistence
- Natural language task operations
- Automatic synchronization with TodoWrite/TodoRead tools

## Technical Approach

1. **File Structure Integration**
   - Use `backlog/{status}/` directories for task storage
   - Map SuperClaude tasks to Backlog.md format
   - Preserve existing task metadata in YAML frontmatter

2. **Command System Integration**
   - Create `/backlog` command for Kanban operations
   - Enhance `/task` command to use Backlog.md as storage
   - Add natural language support for task operations

3. **Todo Synchronization**
   - Bidirectional sync between TodoWrite/TodoRead and Backlog.md
   - Store todos in task frontmatter under `superclaude.todos`
   - Update task progress based on todo completion

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/backlog board` displays visual Kanban board
- [ ] `/backlog create` creates new tasks in Backlog.md format
- [ ] Tasks can be moved between columns (todo/in-progress/done)
- [ ] TodoWrite/TodoRead automatically sync with Backlog.md tasks
- [ ] Session recovery works with Backlog.md storage
- [ ] Natural language commands work ("show my tasks", "move task 42 to done")
- [ ] Documentation updated with Backlog.md usage

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- Created Backlog.md directory structure
- Designed integration architecture
- Created `/backlog` command documentation
- Implemented patterns and implementation logic YAML files
- Updated task-management-patterns.yml with Backlog.md integration

### In Progress
- Adding Backlog.md references to SuperClaude configuration

### Todo
- Test the integration end-to-end
- Create example workflows
- Update main documentation

## Notes

The integration leverages Backlog.md's simplicity while maintaining SuperClaude's advanced features. The markdown-based storage ensures tasks are git-friendly and human-readable.
