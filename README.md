**A lightweight framework that transforms generic Claude Code into your specialized development partner – no external tools, no complex setup, just pure configuration magic.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Claude Code is powerful, but let's be honest – it's generic. You find yourself:
- Losing context mid-debugging session
- Repeating the same instructions every project
- Wishing it understood YOUR coding style
- Watching tokens vanish on verbose responses

## ✨ Enter SuperClaude

Think of it as a brain upgrade for Claude Code. Drop it in once, and suddenly Claude:
- **Remembers everything** with Git-based checkpoints
- **Thinks like you want** with 9 specialized personas
- **Works 70% more efficiently** with token optimization
- **Never guesses** – always finds the official docs first

## 🚀 Zero-Friction Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NomenAK/SuperClaude.git
cd SuperClaude
./install.sh                           # Default: ~/.claude/
# OR
./install.sh --dir /opt/claude          # Custom location
./install.sh --dir ./project-claude    # Project-specific
```

That's it. No databases, no services, no dependencies. Installs to `~/.claude/` by default or any directory you choose. The installer even backs up your existing config automatically!

## 💡 Why You'll Love It

### 🔄 **Never Lose Context Again**
Git-integrated checkpoint system lets you jump back to any point in your conversation. Debugging a nasty bug at 3am? Create a checkpoint. Need to try a different approach? Roll back and branch off.

### 📚 **Smart Documentation That Evolves**
Your docs write themselves using our token-optimized templates. Project docs go in `/docs`, while Claude's working notes live in `/.claudedocs`. Everything stays organized, nothing gets lost.

### 🎭 **9 Instant Personas**
Switch Claude's entire mindset with one command:

```bash
/persona:architect    # Big-picture system design mode
/persona:frontend     # Pixel-perfect UI obsession mode
/persona:security     # Paranoid threat-modeling mode
/persona:analyzer     # Sherlock Holmes debugging mode
```

Each persona thinks differently, asks different questions, and solves problems their own way.

### ⚡ **18 Power Commands**
Real shortcuts for real work:

```bash
/user:build --react        # Spin up a React app with YOUR standards
/user:troubleshoot --prod  # Production fire? This knows what to do
/user:analyze --security   # Full security audit in seconds
/user:git --checkpoint     # Save your progress before that risky refactor
```

### 🧠 **Actually Intelligent Integration**
- **Context7** finds library docs instantly (no more "I think this is how it works")
- **Sequential** thinking for complex problems (watch it reason step-by-step)
- **Magic** generates UI components that actually match your style
- **Puppeteer** tests everything in a real browser

### 🚄 **70% More Efficient**
Our UltraCompressed mode strips unnecessary tokens without losing clarity. More context, longer conversations, bigger projects – same token budget.

## 🎮 Quick Start Examples

### The "New Project" Flow
```bash
/persona:architect
/user:design --api --ddd     # Domain-driven design from the start
/user:estimate --detailed    # Know what you're getting into
/persona:backend
/user:build --api --tdd      # Build it right the first time
```

### The "Something's Broken" Flow
```bash
/persona:analyzer
/user:troubleshoot --investigate --prod
/user:analyze --profile      # Find the real bottleneck
/persona:performance
/user:improve --performance --threshold 90%
```

### The "Make It Pretty" Flow
```bash
/persona:frontend
/user:build --react --magic  # AI-generated components
/user:test --e2e --pup       # See it work in a real browser
/user:improve --quality      # Polish until it shines
```

## 🔧 How It Actually Works

SuperClaude is pure configuration – no code, no external dependencies. It works by:

1. **Loading specialized instructions** when Claude Code starts
2. **Activating different rulesets** based on your commands
3. **Switching cognitive modes** through personas
4. **Optimizing token usage** automatically

The framework includes:
- **CLAUDE.md** – Core configuration and behaviors
- **RULES.md** – Engineering standards and practices
- **PERSONAS.md** – 9 specialized thinking modes
- **MCP.md** – Smart tool orchestration
- **18 Commands** – Ready-made workflows
- **26 Shared Resources** – Battle-tested patterns

## 🎨 Pick Your Fighter (Persona)

| Persona | Superpower | Activate When You Need... |
|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| **architect** | Sees the big picture | System design that scales |
| **frontend** | UX perfectionist | Interfaces users love |
| **backend** | Performance obsessed | APIs that never fail |
| **security** | Professional paranoid | Code that's bulletproof |
| **analyzer** | Root cause detective | To solve the unsolvable |

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### Thinking Modes
Control how deep Claude analyzes:
```bash
"think about X"              # Standard analysis
"think hard about Y"         # Architecture-level depth
"ultrathink Z"               # When you need EVERYTHING considered
```

### Smart Tool Control
```bash
--c7           # Force documentation lookup
--seq          # Force step-by-step reasoning
--magic        # Force UI component generation
--no-mcp       # Use only native tools
--all-mcp      # Kitchen sink mode
```

### Evidence-Based Everything
No more "this is better" without proof. SuperClaude enforces:
- Metrics for performance claims
- Documentation for library usage
- Test results for quality assertions
- Security scans for safety claims
